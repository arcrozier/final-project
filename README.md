## Overview
PhotoBracket is an application that allows users to upload and sort through images. The home screen
 prompts users to select images from their computer directly. From there, the program will ask
  users choose their favorite of two photos at a time. The chosen picture will advance to the next
   round of comparisons while the photo not selected will be discarded. This process continues
    until the user is satisfied with all remaining photos. At this point, the user can chose to
     save the remaining images to a folder on their computer, upload more photos to sort, or exit
      the application.

## Using Photo Bracket

### Getting Started
To being, compile and run Main. From there, a separate window will appear where users can interact
 with the app. First, the "Find files" button is to be clicked. This will prompt the user to select
 images from their computer. The users will only be allowed to chose jpeg, jpg, or png files. The
  sorting will not begin until at least two photos have been uploaded. Once this condition is met,
   the program will automatically being the sorting process.

### Comparing Images
Sorting begins with the program displaying two randomly selected images at a time. At this point,
 the user has four options. They must select one of the four buttons found at the bottom of the
  window. These buttons are "Left," "Both," "Different Pics," and "Right." The user should select
   "Left" if they prefer the image on the left side of the screen, "Right" if they prefer the image
    on the right side of the window, "Both" if they want both images to advance to the next round,
     or "Different pics" if they would like to keep not compare these images and would like to
      compare different images. This action will not eliminate the images, it will instead add them
       back to the list of images for the current round and present them to be compared later to
        different images. This process continues until the user no longer wants to sort images. If
         the user is down to one image left or has indicated liking all remaining images (by
          failing to eliminate any of them), they will be notified of this by a popup window. The
           user will then be asked to save the images or to continue sorting.

### File Dropdown

#### Saving Images
To save all remaining images, the user should select the "File" dropdown in the upper lefthand
 corner. Next, they should select "Export favorites." This will prompt the user to either save
  the images to a existing folder on their
   computer or to create a new folder to save the images to.

#### Selecting More Photos
At any time, the user can click on the "File" dropdown and select "Select more photos" to add
 photos to the current
  round they are in to be sorting with the remaining images.

#### Sort New Photos
At any time, the user can click on the "File" dropdown and select "Sort new photos" to eliminate
 all remaining photos
  and select new ones from their computer.

#### Clear Favorites
At any time, the user can click on the "File" dropdown and select "Clear favorites" to empty the
 images currently stored
  in favorites.
