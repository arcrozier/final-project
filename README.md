## Overview
PhotoBracket is an application that allows users to upload and sort through images. The home screen
prompts users to select images from their computer directly. From there, the program will ask
users choose their favorite of two photos at a time. The chosen picture will advance to the next
round of comparisons while the photo not selected will be discarded. This process continues
until the user is satisfied with all remaining photos. At this point, the user can chose to
save the remaining images to a folder on their computer, upload more photos to compare, or
exit the app.

## Using Photo Bracket

### Getting Started
To begin the user should compile all files and run Main. From there, a separate window will appear
where users can interact with the app. First, the **Find files** button must be clicked. This will
prompt the user to select images from their computer. The users will only be allowed to choose
jpeg, jpg, gif, tiff, tif or png files. Sorting will not begin until at least two photos have
been uploaded. Once this condition is met, the program will automatically being the sorting
process.

### Comparing Images
Sorting begins with the program displaying two random images uploaded by the user. At this point,
the user has four options. They must select one of the four buttons found at the bottom of the
window. These buttons are **Left**, **Both**, **Different Pics**, and **Right**. The user should
select:
* **Left** if they prefer the image on the left side of the window. This can also be accomplished
 by selecting the left arrow key on the keyboard;
* **Right** if they prefer the image on the right side of the window. This can also be accomplished
 by selecting the right arrow key on the keyboard;
* **Both** if they want both images to advance to the next round or.  This can also be accomplished
 by selecting the up arrow key on the keyboard;
* **Different pics** if they would like to not compare these images and instead choose between
 different images. This action will not eliminate the images, but will add them back to the list
 of images for the current round and present them later to be compared to different images. This can
 also be accomplished by selecting the down arrow key on the keyboard;

As a quick feedback message, a green box will appear around the chosen images. The user will be
asked to sort through all uploaded images as the first round. Subsequent rounds will ask the user
to compare only the chosen photos/winners from the previous round. This sorting process continues
until the user no longer can/want to compare images. If the user only has one image remaining or
has indicated liking all remaining images (by failing to eliminate them), they will be notified of
their options by a popup window. This will ask the user to either save the image(s) to favorites or
continue sorting.
* **Save favorites** adds all remaining images to their personal favorites list that may be later
exported to the user's computer
* **Continue sorting** allows the users to eliminate more photos and/or upload new images

### File Dropdown

#### Saving Images
To save all favorite images, the user should select the *File* dropdown in the upper left-hand
corner of the window. Next, they should select *Export favorites* This will prompt the user to
either save the images to an existing folder on their computer or to create a new folder to save
the images to.

#### Selecting More Photos
At any time, the user can click on the *File* dropdown and select *Select more photos* to add
photos to the current round they are in to be compared against the remaining images.

#### Sort New Photos
At any time, the user can click on the *File* dropdown and select *Sort new photos* to eliminate
all remaining photos and select new ones from their computer.

#### Clear Favorites
At any time, the user can click on the *File* dropdown and select *Clear favorites* to empty
 list of favorited images.
