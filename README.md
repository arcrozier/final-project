## Overview
PhotoBracket is an application that allows users to upload and sort through images. The home screen
 prompts users to select images from their computer directly. From there, the program will ask users
  choose their favorite of two photos at a time. The chosen picture will advance to the next round of
  comparisons while the photo not selected will be discarded. This process continues until the user is
   satisfied with all remaining photos. At this point, the user can chose to save the remaining images
    to a folder on their computer, upload more photos to sort, or exit the application.

## Using Photo Bracket

### Getting Started
To being, compile and run Main. From there, a separate window will appear where users can interact with
 the app. First, the "Find files" button is to be clicked. This will prompt the user to select images
  from their computer. The users will only be allowed to chose jpeg, jpg, or png files. The sorting
   will not begin until at least two photos have been uploaded. Once this condition is met, the program
    will automatically being the sorting process.

### Comparing Images
Sorting begins with the program displaying two randomly selected images at a time. At this point, the user
 has four options. They must select one of the four buttons found at the bottom of the window. These buttons
  are "Left," "Both," "Different Pics," and "Right." The user should select "Left" if they prefer the image
   on the left side of the screen, "Right" if they prefer the image on the right side of the window, "Both"
    if they want both images to advance to the next round, or "Different pics" if they would like to keep not
     compare these images and would like to compare different images. This action will not eliminate the images,
      it will instead add them back to the list of images for the current round and present them to be compared
       later to different images. This process continues until the user no longer wants to sort images. If the
        user is down to one image left or has indicated liking all remaining images (by falling to eliminate any
          of them), they will be notified of this by a popup window. The user will then be asked to save the images
           or to continue sorting.

### File Dropdown

#### Saving Images
To save all remaining images, the user should select the "File" dropdown in the upper lefthand corner. Next, they
 should select "Export favorites." This will prompt the user to either save the images to a existing folder on their
  computer or to create a new folder to save the images to.

#### Selecting More Photos
At any time, the user can click on the "File" dropdown and select "Select more photos" to add photos to the current
 round they are in to be sorting with the remaining images.

#### Sort New Photos
At any time, the user can click on the "File" dropdown and select "Sort new photos" to eliminate all remaining photos
 and select new ones from their computer.

#### Clear Favorites 
At any time, the user can click on the "File" dropdown and select "Clear favorites" to empty the images currently stored
