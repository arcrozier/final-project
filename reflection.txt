We gained a lot of knowledge from this project. First and foremost, we experienced the challenges of
code collaboration first-hand. There were a few occasions in which a team member needed to utilize
a portion of the other's code but was unsure of where to find this code. This taught us the
importance of communication and thorough commenting. In relation to the coding itself, we learned
about swing and implementing an interactive user interface. Further, when testing, we realized the 
differences in the ways that different operating systems handle packages. Going forward, we would
choose the most graphically similar images to be compared every time, add background music, and
polish the UI.

Overall, this project as a whole was an enjoyable experience. Being able to work with someone to
create an idea and actually coming together and creating a functioning product was really exciting
and rewarding. While fun, there were a few pain points during the development process. It was
frustrating to debug our code. After our app was working and interactive, we struggled to pinpoint
the exact location of a few bugs which proved to be time consuming and mentally draining. However,
we were able to persevere and complete the product we were happy with. We found that working with a
partner and exploring/learning existing packages was extremely beneficial to our learning.
